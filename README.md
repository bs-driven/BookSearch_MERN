### MOTIVATION
The motivation behind this project is to create a book search engine for a avid reader. Also to display the use of a MERN stack arrangment an implacation; the use of typeDefs, resolvers, and mutations

### PROBLEMS
The problems I faced to beging with was where to start it took me going over things again and again til I could work out what I needed to do next. 
Proper use of the mutation hooks is where I found myself having issues during this project.
Replacing the API routes with mutations were slightly a problem too but it wasn't too diffcult.

### WHAT I LEARNED
What I learned  well ironically I learned is how to use mutations to a better degree.
Along with the react useEffect was something else I learned to use a better degree.
